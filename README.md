*Here are some of the major software download sites, there are a number of OSX Mac software sites*

### Genuine Sites

* [alternativeTo](http://alternativeto.net/) - Also a very nice community. If you are looking for some alternative apps **FOR** Windows or another platform, check this site.
* [Slant](https://www.slant.co) - I personally recommend this. This is a platform where you can compare apps side-by-side, you might get an idea by seeing other users recommendations. Please contribute if you find an application from this list!
* Also, [Quora](https://www.quora.com/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com), you know the drill.
* App Shopper：[http://appshopper.com/](http://appshopper.com/)
