* [Slant](https://www.slant.co) - I personally recommend this. This is a platform where you could compare apps side-by-side. You might get an idea by other users who may struggle just like you. Contribute if you know something. ![tuijian][tuijian Icon] ![hot][hot Icon]
* [alternativeTo](http://alternativeto.net/) - Also a very nice community. If you are looking for some alternative apps **FROM** Windows or other platform, `else if` you want some alternative apps **FOR** Windows platform, check this site.
* Other sites like [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/), [LifeHacker](http://lifehacker.com/), [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/topics/mac) is somewhere else you could go for.
* Also, [Quora](https://www.quora.com/), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com), you know the drill.
* MacUpdate：[https://www.macupdate.com/](https://www.macupdate.com/)
* App Shopper：[http://appshopper.com/](http://appshopper.com/)
* [HackStore](http://hack-store.com) it is an amazing free alternative of App Store for side developers and apps for Mac OS which Apple doesnt accept.
